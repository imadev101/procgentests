# Procedural Generation Test

# #01 First try

In the first try, I simply spawn one entity.

An entity will spawn at random x and y velocity, which means random speed and direction.
An entity can sprout another randomly, that consumes mana and pixels to spawn another entity.
An entity can spawn up to 10 entity.

There is a max depth. At 60 fps, it took about an hour to spawn 60 000 with current settings.

First try was this commit :
